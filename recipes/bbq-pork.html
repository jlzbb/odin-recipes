                    <li>⅓ cup hoisin sauce</li>                       
                    <li>⅓ cup ketchup</li>                     
                    <li>⅓ cup brown sugar</li>                     
                    <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed</li>                
                    <li>1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder</li>                     
                    <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>                   
                    <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>                  
                    <li>⅛ teaspoon pink curing salt (Optional)</li>                  
                    <li>1 (3 pound) boneless pork butt (shoulder)</li>                 
                    <li>1 teaspoon red food coloring, or as desired (Optional)</li>               
                    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place soy sauce, honey, rice wine, hoisin sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, garlic, five-spice powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and curing salt in a saucepan. Bring to a boil on high heat; reduce heat to medium-high. Cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat. Cool to room temperature.</li>
                    <li>Cut pork roast in half lengthwise. Cut each half again lengthwise forming 4 long, thick pieces of pork.</li>
                    <li>Transfer cooled sauce to a large mixing bowl. Stir in red food coloring. Place pork sections into sauce and coat each piece. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 to 12 hours.</li>
                    <li>Preheat grill for medium heat, 275 to 300 degrees F (135 to 150 degrees C) and lightly oil the grate. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>Remove sections of pork from marinade and let excess drip off. Place on prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with kosher salt to taste.</li>
                    <li>Transfer pork sections to grate over indirect heat on the prepared grill. Cover and cook for about 45 minutes. Brush with marinade; turn. Continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 1 hour and 15 minutes more. Do not use any more marinade on cooked meat until after you boil it.</li>
                    <li>Place leftover marinade in a saucepan; bring to a boil; let simmer for 1 minute. Remove from heat. Now you can use it to brush over the cooked pork.</li>
                </ol>
